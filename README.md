Imagine that Freedom ran a recent marketing campaign to promote the value proposition of how the debt relief program helps people achieve financial freedom. Assume the cost of this campaign was $5 million. There are five months of data in the datasets provided. Letâ€™s say campaign took place over the course of the third month. You now want to show the marketing, sales and operations teams just how successful this campaign was.

Using the three datasets given:

- **Provide a quantitative assessment of whether the marketing campaign was successful. How and why did you choose your specific success metric(s)?**

- **Based on the provided data, how would you recommend campaign strategy be adjusted in the future to improve performance?**

- **How do you think campaign performance would have changed if we did not run the campaign in Month 3, but instead postponed it until month 6? Provide an incremental number versus your result in Question #1.**

- **Customer Profile**:
  - Customers have substantial debt and face unexpected hardships.
  - Unable to make minimum monthly payments.
  
- **Enrollment in Debt Relief Program**:
  - Customers cease payments to creditors.
  - Make affordable deposits into a dedicated bank account with Freedom Debt Relief.

- **Negotiation and Settlement**:
  - Freedom negotiates with creditors to settle debt at a fraction of the original amount.
  - Facilitates payments to creditors from the dedicated account based on settlement agreements.
  
- **Fees and Earnings**:
  - Freedom collects fees from clients for each settled account.
  - The number of settlement agreements is proportional to monthly deposited amounts.
  
- **Assumptions for Analysis**:
  - Use industry statistics for any missing analysis input.
  - Include fee percentages and ongoing costs per client from enrollment to graduation.
  - Imagine Freedom Debt Relief ran a marketing campaign to show how their program helps people achieve financial freedom.
  - The campaign cost was $5 million and ran during the third month of the provided data.
  - You want to demonstrate the campaign's success to the marketing, sales, and operations teams.

### Assume the following:

- There is no seasonality in the results, and the campaign spend was distributed evenly across Month 3 (i.e., spend on the first day is the same as spend on the last day).
- Channel mix, targeting, and efficiency are outside the scope of this exercise, but you may address it after answering the 3 questions.
- There may be data provided that is not useful in your analysis.
